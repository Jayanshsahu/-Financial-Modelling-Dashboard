🧠 Project Problem Statement


In modern businesses, financial data is complex and scattered, making it difficult to derive 
actionable insights in real time. Stakeholders, analysts, and decision-makers often face challenges in:

Tracking key performance indicators (KPIs)

Monitoring revenue, profit, and cost metrics over time

Visualizing financial trends clearly and interactively

Making data-backed budgeting and forecasting decisions

✅ Proposed Solution
To tackle the above problem, we developed a Financial Modelling Dashboard using Microsoft Power BI.
This dashboard consolidates critical financial metrics and transforms raw data into visual insights that help decision-makers:

Track profitability and revenue growth

Analyze year-over-year trends

Compare actual vs. forecasted financial figures

Gain clarity on cost structure and investment allocation




📥 Data Source

The data was sourced from Excel/CSV-based financial statements and reports, including:

Profit & Loss statements

Budgeted vs. actual financial reports

Sales and operating expense reports

These datasets were cleaned, transformed, and imported into Power BI for interactive dashboard creation.




📌 Dashboard Highlights
The Power BI report includes the following key visual elements:

💵 Revenue vs. Expenses Breakdown

📈 Profitability Trends (monthly/quarterly)

🧾 Cost Allocation Visualization

📊 Budget vs. Actual Analysis

🔍 Interactive Filters by region, department, and date range

🧮 KPI Cards for quick reference (e.g., Net Profit Margin, Gross Profit, Operating Income)
