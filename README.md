🧠 Project Problem Statement


                     In modern businesses, financial data is complex and scattered, making it difficult to derive 
                     actionable insights in real time. Stakeholders, analysts, and decision-makers often face challenges in:

                     Tracking key performance indicators (KPIs)

                     Monitoring revenue, profit, and cost metrics over time

                     Visualizing financial trends clearly and interactively

                     Making data-backed budgeting and forecasting decisions





 

✅ Proposed Solution
                     To tackle the above problem, we developed a Financial Modelling Dashboard using Microsoft Power BI.
                     This dashboard consolidates critical financial metrics and transforms raw data into visual insights that help decision-makers:

                     Track profitability and revenue growth

                     Analyze year-over-year trends

                     Compare actual vs. forecasted financial figures

                     Gain clarity on cost structure and investment allocation







📥 Data Source

                     The data was sourced from Excel/CSV-based financial statements and reports, including:

                     Profit & Loss statements

                     Budgeted vs. actual financial reports

                     Sales and operating expense reports

                     These datasets were cleaned, transformed, and imported into Power BI for interactive dashboard creation.
